# Kickstarter-Project-Analysis
This project involves the analysis of Kickstarter projects using MS Excel.

**Introduction-** In this project, the success rate of numerous initiatives that were launched on the Kickstarter is analysed. With more than 300,000 rows of data, this study offers insightful information on the crowdfunding market and can assist individuals and organisations in making defensible choices regarding the launch of projects.

**Data-** The data used in this project is a compilation of information on various Kickstarter projects. The variables included in the dataset are:

-Unique project names
-Category
-Subcategory
-Country
-Launched date
-Deadline date
-Amount of money the creator needs to complete the project (USD)
-Amount of money pledged by the crowd (USD)
-Number of backers
-Current condition the project is in (successful, failed, live, suspended, or canceled)

**Methodology-** The following steps were part of the methodology utilised for this project:
1. Data cleaning: To make sure the data was accurate and ready for analysis, it was cleaned.
2. Data analysis: Microsoft Excel's many tools and functionalities, such as pivot tables, charts, and statistical analysis, were used to examine the data.
3. Gaining insights on the success of Kickstarter projects was done using the analysis's findings.

**Analysis-** As part of the analysis, I looked at the connections between various dataset characteristics and how they affected the success of Kickstarter campaigns. For instance, the effect of the duration between the launch date and the deadline, the funding goal, and the total number of backers were all studied. In order to pinpoint popular themes and their influence on success, trends in categories and subcategories were also looked at.

**Results-** The analysis's findings demonstrated that several elements, such the interval between the launch date and the deadline, the funding goal, and the amount of backers, had a big influence on how successful Kickstarter campaigns are. The outcome also demonstrated that, in order to be on the safe side and take into account all the insights, initiatives or investments should be created or made in the fields of Music, Design, Technology, and Games while also taking into account the subcategory and duration.

**Conclusion-** This analysis offers insightful information about the elements that influence the success of Kickstarter campaigns. Creators can launch their own initiatives with greater confidence if they are aware of the variables that affect these projects' success.
